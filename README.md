# AutoStruct3D
AutoStruct3D is a Python-based platform that automates the generation of 3D building models for construction applications. The system takes user-defined requirements like number of rooms, bathroom count, size, cupboard inclusion, and color preferences, and then automatically creates fully-featured 3D models in formats like .obj and .stl.

‚úÖ 1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
AutoStruct3D is a Python-based platform that automates the generation of 3D building models for construction applications. The system takes user-defined requirements like number of rooms, bathroom count, size, cupboard inclusion, and color preferences, and then automatically creates fully-featured 3D models in formats like .obj and .stl.
1.2 Scope
Fully automated generation of 3D buildings from structured inputs (JSON/CSV)
Support for parametric design
Intelligent reuse of prior design patterns for optimization
Export-ready formats for use in CAD or simulation
Integrates learned layouts from previous models for improved automation
Prevents logical and geometric overlaps via internal validation
1.3 Users
Civil Engineers
Architects
Construction Planners
Educational Institutes
