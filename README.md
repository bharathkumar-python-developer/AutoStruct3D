# AutoStruct3D
AutoStruct3D is a Python-based platform that automates the generation of 3D building models for construction applications. The system takes user-defined requirements like number of rooms, bathroom count, size, cupboard inclusion, and color preferences, and then automatically creates fully-featured 3D models in formats like .obj and .stl.
